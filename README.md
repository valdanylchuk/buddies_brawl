# Buddies Brawl

A simple card battle game, similar to many TCGs, simplified to the extreme.
Currently, it does not even have an energy system.

This is a weekend hobby project, an experiment in minimalism.
Shared as-is. Do not expect much in terms of support or further development.
No goal to reproduce anything in full.

## Features

- 8 cards, somewhat playable as a 20-card deck
- web UI, desktop/mobile (PWA config in progress)
- basic AI player
- an tournament script for deck balancing and AI refinement

## Why did I make it?

Just for fun. It is a special way to experience a game as a programmer.

I usually work with backend code, and avoid JS and frontend as much as I can.
But with zero expectations, and the help of modern AI, it is tolerable.

## Things I learned

- Typescript feels much nicer than Javascript
- Self-made TCGs become fun to play with surprisingly few cards and rules
- Confirmed: coding AIs still require a lot of oversight and corrections for okay quality
- Confirmed: complexity grows quickly with features
- Confirmed: bigger, nicer hobby projects are feasible today
